# Subgroups of ℤ/nℤ × ℤ/nℤ

**Project proposed by [Olivier Brunat](https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~olivier.brunat/)**

This project explores the problem of describing the subgroups of the group ℤ/nℤ × ℤ/nℤ, which poses a challenging question in finite abelian group theory. While the subgroups of a cyclic group are easy to describe, determining the subgroups of a product like ℤ/nℤ × ℤ/nℤ is much more complex.

## Theoretical Overview

We will explore:
- Lattices in ℤᵐ and integer matrices.
- Subgroups of ℤᵐ generated by the column vectors of integer matrices.
- Hermite and Smith normal forms of integer matrices, which have applications beyond this project, including cryptography.

Additionally, we will explore the finite group theory approach via **Goursat’s lemma** and compare both approaches.

## Practical Implementation

The project includes the development of algorithms to:
- Compute the Hermite and Smith normal forms of an integer matrix.
- Generate the subgroup lattice of ℤ/nℤ × ℤ/nℤ for a given integer *n*.

### Requirements

- OCaml and related tools (e.g., `opam`, `dune` for managing OCaml projects).
- Ensure you have installed necessary libraries via `opam`:

```bash
opam install dune
```

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/napoknot21/subgroups.git
cd subgroups
```

2. **Build the project** using the `Makefile`:

```bash
make
```

3. **Run the program**:

```bash
./run.sh <n>
```

Replace `<n>` with the integer value for *n* to generate the lattice of subgroups for ℤ/nℤ × ℤ/nℤ.

### Example Usage

For *n = 12*, you would run:

```bash
./run.sh 12
```

This will output the lattice of subgroups of ℤ/12ℤ × ℤ/12ℤ.

### File Structure

- `bin/`: Contains compiled binaries.
- `lib/`: Source code for algorithms.
- `test/`: Test cases and example inputs.
- `rapport/`: Contains the final project report with theoretical background and algorithm analysis.
- `soutenance/`: Presentation materials for the project defense.

### Output

The output will display:
- Hermite and Smith normal forms of the input matrix.
- The lattice of subgroups for ℤ/nℤ × ℤ/nℤ.
